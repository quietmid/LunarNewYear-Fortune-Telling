<h1>Fortune Telling Website for Lunar New Year Party</h1>
<h3>This is a personal project</h3>

<p>The goal is to include more a bit more of Asian culture in the Lunar Party that I am hosting with a couple friends. 
  Besides food, I thought that fortune telling has always been a really big thing in Asia, especially during new year.
  Since the attendees are all close friends, I decided that since I am studying coding that I will take a on small passion project
  that add a bit more to the party than just Asian foods and drinks.</p>

  <p>I used the html/css/js files from an attempt at creating my own webiste prior to starting Hive. It just had the bare backbone of some CSS and html codes.
    In two days, I relearned how to create elements and functions that would make the website semi-functional and still has the humor for the visitors.
    I also learned that how to include a drag down menu for the birth year rather than then inputting the birth dates. In this way, people will be able to find their zodiac sign quicker.
    I learned that convenience is a big thing in website design. I wanted to make the music autoplay but I learned that many of the modern broswer has disable that.
    I also added buttons to return to the beginning, so they can check out different zodiac's forecast and flaws.</p>
