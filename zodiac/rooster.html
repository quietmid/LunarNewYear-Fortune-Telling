			<h3> Here is your forecast for the Year of Wood Dragon</h3>
			<p>
				Roosters will have plenty to crow about in 2024: recovering from your clash year of 2023, the feng shui winds blow in your favour with some very auspicious stars in your chart to offer their support. You will feel empowered, motivated and ready to take on whatever is presented to you, which may be many opportunities to step onto the stage and follow some lifelong dreams. You have been diligent and worked hard behind the scenes these past five years.</p>
			<p>
				As the Dragon is your astrological best friend, the energy of 2024 brings rewards and recognition. The Dragon not only brings support but also resolves past issues, allowing a sense of freedom to permeate your daily life. Roosters love to strut their stuff mostly because they are good at it! However, in this year of reward and accolades, be careful not to crow too much, otherwise you may easily offend others as risk your reputation. If you are able to, do charity work – this would be very rewarding for many. However, remember you can only help others fully from a full cup, so look after your health, which may be weak at times under the Dragon’s influence.
