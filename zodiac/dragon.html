			<h1> I guess this is your year huh?</h1>

			<h3> Here is your forecast for the Year of Wood Dragon</h3>
			<p>
				This is your astrological year, Dragons, so be prepared to step into the limelight. Whenever you step into your year, its wise to be cautious and tread carefully to avoid any potholes, obstacles and setbacks. It is also advised that you visit the temple to receive blessings and protection, as you are deemed to be offending the God of the year, aka Tai Sui. Shedding a little blood, such as having your teeth cleaned before the end of April, is another form of self-protection against accidents and injuries.</p>
			<p>
				Determination and a good sense of timing is required to navigate your way through the year, to make gains, progress and harness the support of two auspicious stars, which help your personal empowerment to receive rewards for your past efforts. Be on full alert when out and about and travelling to destinations that may suffer extreme weather. Make health and safety a priority.
