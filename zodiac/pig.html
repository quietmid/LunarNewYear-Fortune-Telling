			<h3> Here is your forecast for the Year of Wood Dragon</h3>
			<p>
				The past two years have been demanding for those born in the Years of the Pig in a variety of circumstances. 2024 heralds a change in energy, allowing life and luck to stabilise becoming less erratic and unpredictable. Two stars indicating prosperity and power allow you to find “truffles” of opportunities increasing your fame and fortune. A great year for romance and even to tie the knot for some. Your social life generally receives a boost, increasing your popularity, so expect to be everywhere as your “dance card” will be full for most of the year! New meetings are on the horizon as your energy shines bright with less daily confines of concerns. </p>
			<p>
				You feel in control, so approach 2024 with your unique style, panache and an abundance of confidence. Just bear in mind, like many of the signs this year, your luck can only be truly maximised with good health.

			<p>Your Lucky Colors: Yellow and Blue</p>
