			<h3> Here is your forecast for the Year of Wood Dragon</h3>
			<p>
				If you are lucky to be born in the Ox years, you may look forward to a year of steady progress due to the blessings of many lucky stars in your chart. Wealth potential appears strong enough to carry you forth towards positive results, and there is an upwards trajectory in your career and any business ventures. You may be in contact with or meet new and inspiring individuals who, with timely support, may be in powerful positions of authority to open doors for future prosperity or to help you achieve your goals. </p>
			<p>
				You are required to work hard, keep calm and remain current to facts and figures especially when in negotiations, so double check everything before introducing your ideas. It pays to play your cards close to the chest for much of the year. You may encounter disputes as one star in your chart does show up with the potential to cause disharmony, so be on guard for any office politics to protect your luck, especially during your weaker months of June, July and October.
