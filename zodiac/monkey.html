			<h3> Here is your forecast for the Year of Wood Dragon</h3>
			<p>
				Your luck is in your dexterous hands in 2024, and your monkey resilience, curiosity and problem-solving mindset never lets you down. Although your strength is stronger when solving physical issues, this year calls for a different strength: overcoming frequent problems caused by competitive forces, so expect to be challenged on a personal level. Your luck in 2024 comes from being strategic and setting some ground rules and personal boundaries as to who you take into your trust, as there may be many opinions flying around but with little substance to your personal well-being. </p>
			<p>
				Maintain your focus and motivation, as much will be expected of you. Know when to withdraw to protect yourself from ill advice. For many born in the years of the monkey, this may be a transitional and major year for life changes such as relocations. Your decisions in 2024 will be important to the next phase of your life, so make the right one by listening to your heart.
