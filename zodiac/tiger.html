			<h3> Here is your forecast for the Year of Wood Dragon</h3>
			<p>
				Resilience is the name of the game for you in 2024, as this could be a tumultuous and rather a roller coaster year. Health will play an important role as to how much energy you can put in to make the best of potential new opportunities. You may suffer from fatigue caused by endless challenges, so pace yourself to prevent becoming overwhelmed. You need a clear mind to make major decisions and to be able to embrace new areas and experiences, due to two major stars which are demanding of action involving travel. Be open to accepting advice from those who may have been in a similar position. Wealth luck appears strong and is enhanced by spreading your wings to consider a relocation.
