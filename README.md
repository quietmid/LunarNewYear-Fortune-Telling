# Fortune Telling Website for Lunar New Year Party

## Project: 
The goal is to include more a bit more of Asian culture in the Lunar Party that I am hosting with a couple friends.
Besides food, I thought that fortune telling has always been a really big thing in Asia, especially during new year.
Since the attendees are all close friends, I decided that since I am studying coding that I will take on a small passion project that add a bit more to the party than just foods and drinks.

## Languages:

For this project, I recycled some html/css/js files that I had before starting Hive in October 2023. The original files were aimed to create my own website that will showcase both of my coding projects and multimedia work samples.

## Process & Features

In two days, I relearned how to create elements and functions that would make the website easy to navigate and still has some humor for the users.
- drop down menu to select birth year
- music embedded with easy to access controller

## Examples

## Learning:
From this project
I also learned that how to include a drag down menu for the birth year rather than then inputting the birth dates. In this way, people will be able to find their zodiac sign quicker. 
I learned that convenience is a big thing in website design. I wanted to make the music autoplay but I learned that many of the modern broswer has disable that. I also added buttons to return to the beginning, so they can check out different zodiac's forecast and flaws.
