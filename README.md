# Fortune Telling Website for Lunar New Year Party

## Project: 
The goal is to include more a bit more of Asian culture in the Lunar Party that I am hosting with a couple friends.
Besides food, I thought that fortune telling has always been a really big thing in Asia, especially during new year.
Since the attendees are all close friends, I decided that since I am studying coding that I will take on a small passion project that add a bit more to the party than just foods and drinks.

## Languages:

For this project, I recycled some html/css/js files that I had before starting Hive in October 2023. The original files were aimed to create my own website that will showcase both of my coding projects and multimedia work samples.

## Process & Features

In two days, I relearned how to create elements and functions that would make the website easy to navigate and still has some humor for the users.
- drop down menu to select birth year
- music embedded with easy to access controller
- clear navigation, allowing users to move through the website effortlessly

## Examples

## Learning:
<p> From this project, I get to brush up my knowledge in front-end developing and it was really fun in creating this website thinking how my friends would had interact and create feature that suits them. 
On the technology side, I learned how to create interactive buttons and a drop-down menu that saves the user's choice for later used. 
  I also explored linking buttons and png to different pages, improving site navigation. 
  Additionally I learned how to embedd music into the website and learned that many of the browsers have disabled auto play.
These experience helped me strengthen my understanding of web interactivity and user experience.</p>
